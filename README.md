# Office Lab
​
Welcome to your first day at the Flatiron Mifflin Paper Company. As the Assistant to the Regional Manager, your job is to implement the new Office Management System for both the employees and their managers. Since Michael (your boss) has personally tasked you with this job, you can't disappoint. You are being asked to create a three domain models - a `Manager` model, a `Employee` model, and a `Role` model and build out their relationships! 

Here are some questions to consider:
​
* What are your models?
* What does your domain look like?
* What are the relationships between your models? 
* Which model should know about the other in its initialization?
​
## Before you start
1. Run `bundle` to install gems
2. In order to test your code run from the root directory `ruby tools/console.rb`
3. Write all your test code in the `console.rb` file
​
## Here are our deliverables:
_Keep in mind that in order to properly build out the relationships between the three models, one of these classes will be instantiated with objects of others. This will not be mentioned in the description below, you need to deduce it on your own. Consider where and how this dependency needs to be implemented._
​
### **`Manager`**
  * Manager is initialized with a name, department and age. All of these attributes can change.
  <!-- * `Manager#name`
    * returns a `String` that is the manager's name -->
  <!-- * `Manager#department`
    * returns a `String` that is the department that the manager oversees -->
  <!-- * `Manager#age`
    * returns a `Fixnum` that is the age of the manager -->
  * `Manager#employees`
    * returns an `Array` of all the employees that the manager oversees
  * `Manager#roles`
    * returns an `Array` of all the roles that the manager oversees
  <!-- * `Manager.all`
    * returns an `Array` of all the managers -->
  * `Manager.all_departments`
    * returns an `Array` of all the department names that every manager oversees without repetitions
  * `Manager.average_age`
    * returns a `Float` that is the average age of all the managers
​
### **`Employee`**
  * Employee is initialized with a name and salary. All of these attributes can change.
  * `Employee#name`
    * returns a `String` that is the employee's name
  * `Employee#salary`
    * returns a `Fixnum` that is the employee's salary
  * `Employee#manager`
    * returns an instance of their manager
  * `Employee#role`
    * returns an instance of their role
  * `Employee.all`
    * returns an `Array` of all the employees
  * `Employee.paid_over`
    * takes a `Fixnum` argument and returns an `Array` of all the employees whose salaries are over that amount
  * `Employee.find_by_department`
    * takes a `String` argument that is the name of a department and returns the first employee whose manager is working in that department
  * `Employee.search_by_role`
    * takes a `String` argument that is the name of a role and returns all the employees who work at that role
  * `Employee#get_promoted`
    * takes an argument of an instance of a Role, updates Employee's role and increases Employee's salary.
​
### **`Role`**
  * Role is initialized with a name, which won't ever change.
  <!-- * `Role#name`
    * returns a `String` that is the role's name -->
  * `Role#employees`
    * returns an array of all the Employees who work at that role
  * `Role#managers`
    * returns a unique array of all the Manager instances who oversee Employees at that role 
  <!-- * `Role.all`
    * returns an `Array` of all the roles -->
  * `Role#add_employee`
    * takes a `String` argument of an employee's name, a `Fixnum` argument of the employee's salary and an instance of a Manager class and creates a new employee who work at this role
